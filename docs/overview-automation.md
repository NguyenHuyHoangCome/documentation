# Automation
### Use DataTorch to organize the components of your machine learning model.
In Datatorch, **Projects** provide a central location for all of the components of a machine learning project:
- collaborators
- filesources
- datasets
- annotations
- workspaces
- exports

<br />

Create a project in DataTorch and add a team of collaborators with varying permissions.
