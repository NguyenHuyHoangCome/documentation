# Set up files in for annotation in your DataTorch project

Create a project, invite 5 collaborators, and give them different permissions.

## Attach Filesources

Before you can import annotations, make sure you have installed and logged into the DataTorch Python client on the local machine that you will be importing your annotations from.

## Create Dataset

After setting up the Python client, you will need to do some setup in the DataTorch web client to make sure the files and labels in your Project match up to the imported COCO JSON file.

For the files:

- Make a Project in DataTorch
- Create a Dataset containing the raw image files with the exact same filenames as those listed in the COCO JSON file

For the labels:

- Create unique labels in DataTorch with label names matching each of the annotation classes listed in the COCO JSON file

## Create Job

After setting up the Python client, you will need to do some setup in the DataTorch web client to make sure the files and labels in your Project match up to the imported COCO JSON file.

For the files:

- Make a Project in DataTorch
- Create a Dataset containing the raw image files with the exact same filenames as those listed in the COCO JSON file

For the labels:

- Create unique labels in DataTorch with label names matching each of the annotation classes listed in the COCO JSON file
