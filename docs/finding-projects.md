# Exploring Projects

## Discovering projects

If there's a particular topic that interests you, visit
[Topics](https://datatorch.io/topics) webpage. For example, if you are
interested in datasets related to cars, you can find relevant projects by going
to [https://datatorch.io/topics/cars](https://datatorch.io/topics/cars). You can
also search for repositories that match a topic you're interested in. For more
information, see "Searching for repositories."

If you've been active on GitHub, you can find personalized recommendations for
projects and good first issues based on your past contributions, stars, and
other activities in Explore. You can also sign up for the Explore newsletter to
receive emails about opportunities to contribute to DataTorch based on your
interests. To sign up, see Explore email newsletter.
