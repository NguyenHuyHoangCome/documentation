# Introduction

## What is DataTorch?

DataTorch is a scalable, machine learning data tool designed to efficiently
annotate any type of data. It provides a customizable and modular platform with
many advanced features, allowing developers to focus more on building accurate
models.

The purpose of DataTorch is to create a **free platform** for users to **build**,
and **share** different types of machine-learning datasets.

Over the years machine-learning models have become significantly more efficient.
Many of those systems utilize supervised learning techniques and train on large
hand-crafted datasets. Hence efforts have now shifted to produced reliable
datasets for training many of these systems. As these datasets grow, annotating
the images becomes increasingly more challenging and the efficiency of the
annotation tool used becomes more essential. Unfortunately, very few annotation
tools address this need for efficiency and versatility.

DataTorch comes with a plethora of options to integrate with your workflow. Users
can share and extend open-source datasets to speed up data creation. Checkout
