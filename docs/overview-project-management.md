# Project Management
### Use DataTorch to organize the components of your machine learning model.
**Projects** provide a central location for all of the parts of a particular machine learning project:
- collaborators
- filesources
- datasets
- annotations
- workspaces
- exports

<br />

Create a project in DataTorch and add a team of 4 collaborators with varying permissions.
